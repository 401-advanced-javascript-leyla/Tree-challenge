# Tree Challenge
In computer science, a tree is a data structure that simulates hierarchical data with nodes. each node of a tree holds its own data and pointers to other nodes.

## Challenge
Draw a tree
Write 2 paragraphs about how stackDepthFirst and recursiveDepthFirst traverse the tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

###Node
-

###Stack
-push: push a value to the top of the stack
-pop: remove a value off the top of the stack
-peek: have a look at the top of the value of the stack

###Queue
-push: push a value to the end of the queue
-pop: remove a value off the front of the queue
-peek: have a look at the front of the value of the stack
